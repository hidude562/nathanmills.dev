<h2>Misuses of Deep Learning</h2>
    <p>While there are beneficial applications of deep learning, there are several potential misuses of the technology. One such misuse is the use of deep learning for creating fake videos or images. These videos or images can be used to spread misinformation or to deceive people by mediums such as social media for political or financial gain.</p>

    <p>Another misuse of deep learning its use in sensitive decision making, such as in the judicial system or in hiring decisions. The use of deep learning for such purposes can have a large impact on people’s lives, and if the algorithm is not accurate or it is biased, it can lead to inaccurate decisions. Finally, the use of deep learning in surveillance could lead to the tracking of individuals’ movements and activities without their consent or knowledge. This could have a dangerous effect on freedom of speech and other liberties, if the technology is mismanaged.</p>
