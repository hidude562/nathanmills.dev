<h3>Can't open this link in a new tab!</h3>

<p>Nope, cant open this page in a new tab, why? because i am using a stupid fix to make it work, dont worry though, i may update this site to fix that. Plus you would've probably just cluttered up your tabs more which inadvertently makes you use more RAM. This will lead to higher power usages (probably, idk). This means you are COMPLETELY WASTING your electricity and unless your house is fully powered by solar pannels, you are contributing to global warming.</p>

<p>You could have just clicked the link normally but NO, you just had to go and right-click it didn't you. So you go and right-click it and then you go to open the link in a new tab and you see this message telling you that you cant open it in a new tab. So you think to yourself "what am i going to do now? I guess i'll just have to open it in the same tab" and you go and click the link. But then you realize "oh wait, i could have just clicked the link normally in the first place and i wouldnt have had to read this stupid message telling me that i cant open the link in a new tab" and then you go and think about how much you wasted your time reading this stupid message about not being able to open the link in a new tab. The average person can read about 200 words per minute, so that means that you wasted about 58 seconds reading this message up to this point in that amount of time you could:</p>

<ul>
<li>solve a rubiks cube (if you good at it)</li>
<li>make a sandwich</li>
<li>walk about 335 feet (about a football field)</li>
<li>listen to a short song</li>
<li>idk what else</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that you've read this message, delete this tab and go back to the original to open a tab the NORMAL way, if you do not comply, i may have to call the cyber-police on you</p>
