<h2>Annotated Biblography:</h2>
	<p>Allado-McDowell, K., and Irenosen Okojie. <em>Pharmako-Ai</em>. Ignota, 2020.</p>
	<p class="cool-font">This book was written by K Allado-McDowell and co-written by a GPT-3 model (GPT-3 is a state of the art deep learning model that generates text). The book is a novel that is a dialogue between Allado and GPT-3 where GPT-3 writes procedurally generated chapters of stories and poems, while Allado prompts the AI. This book will be useful for understanding the coherence of the AI and how well deep learning models can perform on complex tasks.</p>

	<p class="cool-font">This article is about the applications of deep learning. The article contains studies on the applications and gives challenges about implementing a deep learning approach to the application and also gives current approaches to the challenges. This article can be applicable to address possible benefits of deep learning. It will be used as a minor example in point one where the writing piece introduces the topic of deep learning and its benefits. This article was written by eleven people who are primary sources since they have created deep learning models. This article is also not biased because the article is structured around the statement of facts.</p>

	<a href="https://discovery.ebsco.com/c/npyws4/details/YTloLTE1MDA5NzUzOA">https://discovery.ebsco.com/c/npyws4/details/YTloLTE1MDA5NzUzOA</a>
	<p class="cool-font">This article is about the misuse of deepfakes, which is a subset of deep learning. This article contains four sections that contain what a deep fake is, ethical problems about deepfakes, and real-world consequences of deepfakes. This article will be useful in the primary section of the writing piece because it will be a real example of an unethical use of the technology. This article is reliable as it is published by a well known university and contains many credible sources.</p>
