<h1>The Implications of Deep Learning</h1>

<h2>What is deep learning?</h2>
    <p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn how to do complex tasks, such as recognizing objects in pictures or understanding natural language. Deep learning is able to learn how to do these things by building up a series of layers of simulated neurons that are based off the brain's structure.</p>

    <p>Deep learning has proven to be very effective in tasks where traditional machine learning methods have failed, such as image recognition and natural language processing. This is because deep learning networks can learn to recognize patterns in data that are too complex for traditional machine learning methods to identify.</p>
